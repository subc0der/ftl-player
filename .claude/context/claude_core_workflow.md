# Claude Core Workflow - FTL Hi-Res Audio Player
## Main Development Guidelines & Standards

---

## üéØ Project Overview

**Project Name:** FTL Hi-Res Audio Player  
**Type:** Android Music Player Application  
**Development Approach:** AI-Assisted Development with Claude  
**Primary Goal:** Create the world's most advanced audiophile music player

## üèóÔ∏è Development Philosophy

This project follows an iterative, AI-assisted development methodology where each feature is designed, implemented, tested, and refined in collaboration with Claude AI. The approach emphasizes:

- **Feature-driven development** - One feature at a time
- **Continuous testing and iteration**
- **Performance-first architecture**
- **User experience excellence**
- **Technical innovation**

## üñ•Ô∏è Claude Interaction Guidelines

### When to Use Claude Desktop
- **Project planning and architecture** discussions
- **Complex problem solving** that requires back-and-forth
- **Requirements clarification** and feature specification
- **Code review and optimization** discussions
- **Debugging complex issues** that need explanation

### When to Use Claude CLI
- **Active development** and code implementation
- **File creation and modification**
- **Running tests and build processes**
- **Automated code generation**
- **Large codebase refactoring**

---

## üìã Context Management

### Project Context Setup
Always provide Claude with:
1. **Current milestone** and feature being developed
2. **Recent changes** made to the codebase
3. **Specific requirements** for the current task
4. **Performance constraints** and technical limitations
5. **Integration points** with existing features

### File Organization for Claude
- Keep related files in logical directories
- Use descriptive naming conventions
- Maintain clear separation between layers (UI, business logic, data)
- Document complex algorithms inline
- Keep configuration in easily accessible files

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Feature Development Cycle

1. **Planning Phase** (Claude Desktop)
   - Define feature requirements
   - Design technical approach
   - Identify dependencies and risks
   - Create implementation plan

2. **Implementation Phase** (Claude CLI)
   - Set up development environment
   - Implement core functionality
   - Write unit tests
   - Create initial UI components

3. **Testing Phase** (Claude CLI/Desktop)
   - Run automated tests
   - Perform manual testing
   - Identify and fix bugs
   - Performance optimization

4. **Integration Phase** (Claude CLI)
   - Integrate with existing features
   - Update documentation
   - Commit code changes
   - Prepare for next feature

## üí¨ Communication Guidelines

### Working with Claude

#### Effective Prompting
- **Be specific** about requirements and constraints
- **Provide context** about current project state
- **Ask focused questions** rather than broad requests
- **Include error messages** and specific problems
- **Specify output format** (code, documentation, analysis)

#### Context Preservation
- **Save important discussions** for future reference
- **Document architectural decisions** made with Claude
- **Keep track of feature implementation** progress
- **Maintain changelog** of Claude-assisted developments

#### Iteration Process
- **Start simple** and build complexity gradually
- **Test frequently** and validate assumptions
- **Refactor continuously** for better code quality
- **Document learnings** from each iteration
- **Celebrate achievements** and milestones
