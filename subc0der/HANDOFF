‚óè FTL Hi-Res Audio Player Development Handoff Summary

  Project Status: Functional Music Player Achieved üéµ

  Current State

  The FTL Hi-Res Audio Player has successfully evolved from a technical audio engine demo into a fully functional music player. The app can now
  scan device storage, display music libraries with detailed metadata, and actually play music files when tapped.

  ‚úÖ Major Accomplishments This Session

  üéµ Core Music Player Functionality

  - Music Library Database: Complete Room database schema with Track, Playlist, and PlaylistTrack entities
  - File Discovery Service: MediaStore-based scanning with metadata extraction (sample rate, bit depth, codec)
  - Music Playback Engine: Full MediaPlayer integration - songs actually play when tapped
  - Hi-Res Audio Support: Proper detection and labeling of high-resolution audio files (>48kHz, >16-bit)

  üì± Pixel 9 Pro Optimized UI

  - Bottom Tab Navigation: Library, Playlists, Test, Settings with proper sizing
  - Music Library Browser: Cards showing track info, technical specs, and Hi-Res indicators
  - Permissions System: Android 13+ media permission handling with clear user guidance
  - Responsive Layout: Optimized spacing, typography, and touch targets for Pixel 9 Pro (1344x2992)

  üîß Technical Infrastructure

  - Dependency Injection: Hilt/Dagger integration for MusicRepository and MusicPlayer
  - Error Handling: Comprehensive permission checking, MediaStore error handling, user feedback
  - Logging System: Detailed debugging with emoji-coded logs for easy identification
  - Database Integration: Play count tracking, favorites system, metadata storage

  üß™ Successfully Tested Features

  ‚úÖ Phone Testing Results (Pixel 9 Pro)

  - Permission Flow: Prompts for media access, handles Android 13+ granular permissions
  - Library Scanning: Successfully found and cataloged 10 music files from device
  - Metadata Display: Shows correct sample rates, bit depths, codecs (MP3, WAV Hi-Res)
  - Music Playback: Confirmed working - tracks play when tapped, including Hi-Res files
  - UI Layout: Clean, properly sized interface with resolved text wrapping issues

  üìä Current Music Library Example

  - "Closer" by Kings of Leon (MP3 ‚Ä¢ 48kHz ‚Ä¢ 16bit)
  - "Code and Flesh" by  (WAV ‚Ä¢ 96kHz ‚Ä¢ 24bit) - Hi-Res tagged
  - Total: 10 tracks scanned and playable

  üéØ Architecture Foundation

  Native Audio Engine (Preserved)

  - C++ audio processing pipeline with AAudio API
  - Real-time performance monitoring (22ms latency achieved)
  - 440Hz test tone generator (accessible via Test tab)
  - Ready for integration with music playback system

  Android Integration Layer

  - MediaPlayer-based playback (current implementation)
  - Room database for music library persistence
  - Jetpack Compose UI with Material 3 design
  - Proper Android lifecycle management

  üì¶ Current APK

  - Latest: ftl-player-v1.0.0-006-music-playback.apk (114MB)
  - Status: Fully functional music player
  - Tested: Successfully installed and validated on Pixel 9 Pro

  ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ISSUE TO RESOLVE FIRST

  üîÑ Duplicate Songs Problem

  Priority: HIGH - Must fix before adding new features

  Issue: Multiple duplicate entries of the same songs are appearing in the music library, with additional duplicates being created every time the
  scan function is run.

  Impact:
  - Library becomes cluttered with redundant entries
  - Database grows unnecessarily large with each scan
  - Poor user experience with repeated tracks

  Likely Causes:
  1. Database Insert Strategy: Using OnConflictStrategy.REPLACE but tracks might not have unique identifiers
  2. MediaStore Query: May be returning duplicate entries for same files
  3. File Path Handling: Different path representations for same physical file
  4. Scan Logic: Not checking existing database entries before insertion

  Recommended Fix Approach:
  1. Add Unique Constraints: Ensure database prevents duplicates based on file path
  2. Implement Upsert Logic: Check existing tracks before insertion
  3. Clear Database Option: Add ability to clear and rescan library
  4. File Path Normalization: Standardize path representation
  5. Database Migration: Update schema to handle uniqueness properly

  Files to Examine:
  - MusicRepository.kt: scanMusicLibrary() and discoverAudioFiles() methods
  - TrackDao.kt: Insert operations and conflict resolution
  - Track.kt: Primary key and unique constraint definitions

  üöÄ Future Development Roadmap

  Phase 3: Enhanced Playback Controls

  - Now playing screen with progress bar
  - Play/pause/skip controls
  - Background playback service
  - Lock screen media controls

  Phase 4: Audio Engine Integration

  - Replace MediaPlayer with native C++ audio engine
  - Connect EQ controls to hi-res processing pipeline
  - Real-time audio analysis and visualization
  - Custom DSP effects and enhancements

  Phase 5: Advanced Features

  - Playlist creation and management
  - Smart recommendations using neural networks
  - Biometric integration for mood-based EQ
  - Cloud sync and cross-device functionality

  Technical Debt

  - Implement proper error recovery for playback failures
  - Add comprehensive unit tests for music library operations
  - Optimize database queries for large music collections
  - Implement proper memory management for long playback sessions
