# TensorFlow Lite Models Placeholder

This directory will contain the following TensorFlow Lite models:

1. genre_classification.tflite - Neural network for audio genre classification
2. mood_detection.tflite - Neural network for mood detection from audio features  
3. audio_features.tflite - Feature extraction model for MFCC and spectral analysis
4. eq_optimization.tflite - Neural EQ suggestion model based on content analysis

Models will be trained and added in the next development phase.
For now, the system uses fallback algorithms for basic functionality.
