        Specific use cases and user stories:
        
        **Scenario 1: Workout Session**
        - User starts HIIT workout with heart rate monitor
        - Neural EQ detects elevated heart rate (140+ BPM)
        - Automatically boosts 60-200Hz for motivation, reduces harsh frequencies
        - Adapts in real-time as heart rate changes during intervals
        
        **Scenario 2: Late Night Listening**
        - System detects time (11 PM) and ambient light levels
        - Applies neural "night mode" EQ with gentler frequency response
        - Gradually reduces alerting frequencies to promote relaxation
        
        **Scenario 3: Commuting**
        - GPS detects user in vehicle/transit
        - Microphone samples ambient noise level
        - Applies adaptive noise compensation EQ
        - Intelligently boosts masked frequencies
